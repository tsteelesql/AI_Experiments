# README Generator

A Python-based tool that automates the generation of professional `README.md` files for GitHub projects by analyzing codebases and generating structured documentation using an LLM.

## Description

The **README Generator** is designed to simplify the process of creating well-structured, GitHub-ready `README.md` files from existing Python codebases. By leveraging a combination of file selection UI and large language model (LLM) capabilities, this tool analyzes your project's source code and produces a comprehensive README with sections such as project description, features, installation instructions, usage examples, and more.

This tool uses the [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) library in conjunction with [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) to generate context-aware documentation from your codebase. It supports local development and works best when used alongside a locally running LLM model such as `qwen3-coder`.

## Features

- üìÅ **File Directory Selection**: Intuitive GUI for selecting the root directory of your project.
- üß† **LLM-Powered Documentation Generation**: Automatically generates professional READMEs using an LLM.
- üìù **Structured Output**: Includes all essential sections in a GitHub-friendly format:
  - Project description
  - Features
  - Installation instructions
  - Usage examples
  - Dependencies or requirements
- üîç **Code Analysis**: Reads and aggregates `.py` files from the selected directory recursively.
- üíæ **Save to Disk**: Automatically saves the generated README to the project root.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before using the README Generator, ensure you have:

1. Python 3.8 or higher installed.
2. A locally running instance of [Ollama](https://ollama.com/).
3. The `qwen3-coder` model downloaded in Ollama:
   ```bash
   ollama pull qwen3-coder
   ```

### Steps

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install required Python packages:

```bash
pip install langchain-ollama tkinter
```

> Note: If you're using a virtual environment, make sure it is activated before installing dependencies.

## Usage

Run the script directly:

```bash
python readmeGenerator.py
```

1. A GUI window will open prompting you to select a directory.
2. Choose the root folder of your Python project.
3. Click **Save Path** to confirm and close the window.
4. The tool will:
   - Read all `.py` files from the selected directory (recursively).
   - Generate a README.md file using an LLM.
   - Save the result in the same directory.

### Example Output

After running, your project folder will contain a newly generated `README.md` file that includes content like:

```markdown
# Project Title

## Description

A brief description of what this project does...

## Features

- Feature 1
- Feature 2
